    text: `Hi there 👋🏼 

    I am Thomas Dorfer, a 26 years old web dev student from Austria - Tyrol. Currently, I am doing my semester abroad in computer science at the HS - Kempten.

    In the last 2.5 years, I stuck my head into a variety of different programming languages and skills. Now I am pretty comfortable in creating a robust and staple back end, developing native- or web apps and making data analyses. However, due to university projects in which I was part of the front end team and different front end courses, my current main strength lies in the front end.
    
    My goal for the next year is to go full-stack. I will accomplish this, by mastering Angular, React and Laravel and gaining more experience in client-server architecture, databases and web services.

    When I'm not busy with university or technical stuff, I like to meet friends, to do sports in the mountains, jam with my Band and to travel. These things help me to stay focused and give me a perfect ballance to one of my favourite things in life -> coding 💻!

// Before I started studying, I thought about what my professional future should look like for a long time. At that time I had no idea about programming. Thank goodness I got my hands on a book about JAVA. With this book, I realized that coding makes me happy. Thus I decided to do my current studies and started my own projects to expand my skills.

//  Before I started studying, I had two big questions. First, what should I study and, secondly, what should my professional future look like? At that time I had no idea about programming. Thank goodness I got my hands on a book about JAVA. With this book, I realized that coding makes me happy. Thus I decided to do my current studies and started my own projects to expand my skills.
//  In the last 2.5 years, I stuck my head into a variety of different programming languages and some types of developers. Now I am pretty comfortable in creating the back end logic with PHP, native Android Apps with JAVA or React Native and making data analysis with Python. Furthermore, I am really strong in building the front end with Javascript, HTML and CSS or different Frontend Frameworks.
//  My goal for the next year is to deepen my knowledge in the front end and especially in the back end to work after my studies as a full stack developer. This job would allow me to combine all my preference. Logical thinking and numbers in the backend on the one hand, on the other hand, my creativity  and love for details in the frontend.
