    I am Thomas Dorfer, a 26 years old web dev student from Austria - Tyrol. Currently, I am doing my semester abroad in computer science at the HS - Kempten.

    In the last 2.5 years, I stuck my head into a variety of different programming languages and skills. Now I am pretty comfortable in creating a robust and stable back end, developing native- or web apps and making data analyses. However, due to university projects in which I was part of the front end team and different front end courses, my current main strength lies in the front end.
    
    My goal for the next year is to go full-stack. I will accomplish this, by mastering Angular, React and gaining more experience in client-server architecture, databases and web services.

    When I'm not busy with university or technical stuff, I like to meet friends, do sports in the mountains, jam with my Band and traveling around the world. These things help me to stay focused and give me a perfect balance to one of my favourite things in life -> coding 💻!
